# Warming_Reproductive_Phenology_Data_Code

This repository contains the R code and data used to analyze the effects of climate warming on flowering phenology, fruiting phenology, and reproductive season length (RSL) in woody plants.

The analyses support the study:

**Climate warming advances flowering and fruiting but drives divergent changes in reproductive season length**

## Statistical analyses

All data analyses were conducted using **R version 4.3.3**.

- Linear mixed-effects models were fitted using the **`lme4`** package (version 1.1-35).
- The pseudo-R² of linear mixed-effects models was calculated using the **`MuMIn`** package (version 1.47.5).
- The relative contributions of temperature, accumulated forcing, and precipitation to reproductive season length were quantified using the **`partR2`** package (version 0.9.2).
